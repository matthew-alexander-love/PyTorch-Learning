## Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning

This repository is my work as I work through 
https://www.learnpytorch.io/ with the intention 
of becoming familiar with the PyTorch library.

These notebooks have not been formaly curated and are just 
notes to look back upon as I embark on larger project.

This includes sections on the following and there relationship
with the PyTorch Library:
- Fundamentals of Pytorch
- Basic Workflow
- Basic Classification
- Basic Computer Vision
- Creating Datapipelines for Models
- Modularization of PyTorch Code
- Transfer Learning
- Experiment Tracking with TensorBoard and MLFlow
- Paper Replicating - ViT (Vision Transformer)
- Basic Model Deployment with Gradio and HuggyFace
- Machine Agnostic Models
